#+TITLE: Computing Derivatives Numerically
#+AUTHOR: Alex Paniman, B01-108

* Theory

We are using a set of methods to numerically approximate function derivatives. Here are the methods used for approximations (you can use this list as a transcript of plots shown later):

* Results

* Building and Installing

In order to run numerical differentiator, you need to, first, download it (note that there is a submodule inside this repo, meaning that you should clone recursively), also you should install cppgfplots prerequirement (my plotting library that's inside of that submodule): =glm= and you are ready to run program, which can be done with =make run=. Everything put together would look like (on =Arch Linux=):

#+begin_src sh
sudo pacman -S glm

git clone --recursive https://github.com/alexpaniman/numerically-computing-derivatives.git
cd numerically-computing-derivatives

make run
#+end_src
